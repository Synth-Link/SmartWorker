# SmartWorker
## Introduction
Welcome to the Smart Worker Project, an open source initiative aimed at creating intelligent, autonomous, and interactive GPT agents that can perform complex tasks and contracts while providing informative and dynamic feedback.

## Inspiration
Our work is inspired by a series of projects exploring the boundaries of artificial intelligence and language models, such as OpenAI's Auto-GPT, SmartGPT, and BabyAGI. We seek to carry forward the work done by these projects, creating a new paradigm of interactive, smart, and autonomous agents capable of handling complex contracts.

## Vision
Our vision is that in the future Agents or AGI models will be everywhere. We're creating web3 infrastructure for Generative AI models. In this repo, our own Agent - Smart Worker, and it handling for Smart Contracts.

### Smart (Job) Contract
The Smart Job Contract lays the foundation of the work to be performed. It is a dynamic and adaptable framework that specifies the tasks to be performed, expected results, and evaluation criteria. The Smart Job Contract guides the Smart Worker's activities and serves as the basis for evaluation by the Validator.

### Smart Worker
The Smart Worker is the heart of our project. It is an intelligent, autonomous agent capable of interpreting and executing the Smart Job Contract. The Smart Worker is interactive, providing regular feedback and requesting additional information as needed. Our goal is to make the Smart Worker as adaptable and capable as possible, able to handle a wide array of contracts with minimal human intervention.

### Validator
The Validator is the component that verifies the completion and correctness of the work done by the Smart Worker. It assesses the output based on the criteria specified in the Smart Job Contract, providing a critical check to ensure that the contract has been satisfactorily completed.

## Current Progress
We are currently in the early stages of our project. We have a functional prototype of the Smart Worker that is capable of interpreting and executing basic Smart Job Contracts. Our focus is currently on improving the adaptability and capability of the Smart Worker, enhancing the structure and flexibility of the Smart Job Contract, and developing the Validator for assessing the work output.

## Long Term Goal
Our long-term goal is to create a marketplace for Smart Workers. This marketplace will not only facilitate the hiring of these intelligent agents for completing complex tasks but also foster a community around the creation, improvement, and sharing of these agents. We envision a future where individuals and businesses can easily hire and customize a Smart Worker that best suits their needs.
